- While there are many applications that foster relationships and education within the community of computer science students/developers, this platform seeks to steamline these connections by providing a designated platform for all of these opportunities at once. This forum will allow developers to share their blockers, blog post about recent discoveries, promote job opportunities or upcoming networking events
- The follower/following element will provide users with agency surrounding whose content they can view and whom can view theirs; ensuring their personal feeds are customised to the user's intterests.
- The like/comment features facilitate user interaction in order to foster relationships within this community.
