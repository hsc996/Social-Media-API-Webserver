### 1. Explain the problem that this app will solve, and explain how this app solves or addresses the problem.

This API is designed as a specialised social media platform specifically for software developers; providing a centralised hub to bridge the gap between developers and cutting-edge technology innovation. The platform caters specifically to develoeprs who are interested in experimenting with and contributing to developer who are interested in experimenting with and contributing to emerging technologies: For example, AI, blockchain, quantum computing and emerging programming languages. Users can create posts detailing their experiments, showcase prototypes, and share insights on novel techniques and tools. Similarly, users are also able to engage in "Innovation Threads" that track the development of new ideas and concepts within these fields.

Furthermore, this platform aims to streamline these interactions by consolidating various community-building aspects into one dedicated space. The follower/following feature offers users control over their feed, ensuring that content is tailored to their interests and visibility preferences. Additionally, the like and comment functionalities are designed to foster engagement and strengthen relationships within the developer community. In addition to traditional social media functionalities, this platform also incorporates features tailored to innovation and collaboration. This approach not only enhances commnication and collaboration but also ensures that users can easily navigate and contribute to a vibrant, interconnected network.


```
Users can participate in "Tech Challenges," where they can propose and solve technology-related problems, engage in "Innovation Threads" that track the development of new ideas, and collaborate on open-source projects within the platform. The follower/following system allows users to customize their feeds to include updates on technologies of their interest, influential tech leaders, and groundbreaking research.

The platform also includes a "Tech Trends" feature that aggregates and highlights the latest advancements and discussions in various tech fields, keeping users at the forefront of industry developments. This unique approach not only fosters a community centered around technological innovation but also provides a dedicated space for developers to drive and participate in the future of technology.

### 2. Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project.
**includes proof of thorough usage of specific task management tools through the length of the project**

I developed an implementation plan using a Kanban board in Github Projects, which outlined tasks based on priority. I also used the "roadmap" view in order to visually represent my task timeline by arranging tasks in order of priority per day. While critical tasks were included early in the planning phase, additional tasks were added as specific errors arose. Similarly, I decided to add the "Innovation Thread" later in the planning process in order to make the design more complex, which can be noted in the task list.




### 3. List and explain the third-party services, packages and dependencies used in this app.


### 4. Explain the benefits and drawbacks of this app’s underlying database system.


### 5. Explain the features, purpose and functionalities of the object-relational mapping system (ORM) used in this app.


### 6. Design an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for this app’s database, and explain how the relations between the diagrammed models will aid the database design. 
### This should focus on the database design BEFORE coding has begun, eg. during the project planning or design phase.
