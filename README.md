I developed an implementation plan using a Kanban board in Github Projects, which outlined tasks based on priority. I also used the "roadmap" view in order to visually represent my task timeline by arranging tasks in order of priority per day. While critical tasks were included early in the planning phase, additional tasks were added as specific errors arose. Similarly, I decided to add the "Innovation Thread" later in the planning process in order to make the design more complex, which can be noted in the task list.




### 3. List and explain the third-party services, packages and dependencies used in this app.


### 4. Explain the benefits and drawbacks of this appâ€™s underlying database system.


### 5. Explain the features, purpose and functionalities of the object-relational mapping system (ORM) used in this app.

The object-relational mapping (ORM) system I have used within this API is SQLAlchemy. I opted to use SQLAlchemy as it provides high-level abstraction for interacting with relational databases. In this particular API, the database I have employed is PostgreSQL.


_1) Entity Relationship Diagram_

To ensure a robust ORM setup for my API, the first step is creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). The ERD presents a visual representation of each table, including their attributes, primary keys and foreign keys, as well as the relationships between the tables. This approach defines unique identifiers, enforces referential integreity and aids in promoting data normalisation to minmise data redundancy and duplication.


_2) Mapping Classes (Models) to Tables_

Within the "models" folder is a series of files, each containing the models and schema of each main data table. Each 'entity' in the ERD are translated into SQLAlchemy models: Within my code, the `InnovationThread`, `User`, `Post`, `Comment`, `Like` and `Follower` classes are the models I've created, passing the `(db.Model)` attribute so that SQLAlchemy can recognise these classes are the objects to be mapped into the relational database as tables. Each of the attributes within the ERD are defined as columns using `db.Column` and data types and constraints are specified (e.g. `comment_body = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)`). This is necessary in order for SQLAlchemy to understand how to accurately translate the data into the database.


_3) Relationships and Associations_

These models are also used to establish the relationships and associations within object relational mapping. Within these models, the relationships (which would mirror those of the ERD) have also be defined using the the 'back_populates' attribute. For example, the use of `user = db.relationship("User", back_populates="threads")` in the "InnovationThread" Model ensures that the `User` model's `threads` attribute is kept in sync, allowing bidirectional access between threads and their associated user. However, these attributes/associations look different depending on the intended nature of the entity relationship. For example, the `User` class has a one-to-many relationship with the `InnovationThread` and `Post` classes, as specified here:
```
threads = db.relationship("InnovationThread", back_populates="user")
posts = db.relationship("Post", back_populates="user")
```
This means that a single user can have multiple threads and posts. Whereas the `Follower` class handles many-to-many relationships between users:
```
follower_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'), primary_key=True)
followed_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'), primary_key=True)

follower = db.relationship("User", foreign_keys=[follower_id], back_populates="following_assoc")
followed = db.relationship("User", foreign_keys=[followed_id], back_populates="followers_assoc")
```
This setup, in turn, allows users to follow each other, thus facilitating a dynamic social network.


_4) Validation & Constraints_


I have also used SQLAlchemy to enforce data constraints and validations directly within my model definitions. For example, in this `InnovationThread` class, the `title` column has a constraint to ensure that it is not left empty and does not exceed 100 characters.
```
    @validates('title')
    def validate_title(self, key, title):
        if not title:
            raise ValueError("Title must not be empty.")
        if len(title) > 100:
            raise ValueError("Title must be at most 100 characters long.")
        return title
```
This ensures that any titles stored in the database adheres to these constraints.

Furthermore, I have also defined unique constraints, such as in the `Follower` class, to ensure that a user cannot follow the same user more than once:
```
    __table_args__ = (
        db.UniqueConstraint('follower_id', 'followed_id', name='unique_follow_pair'),
    )
```

### 6. Design an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for this appâ€™s database, and explain how the relations between the diagrammed models will aid the database design. 
### This should focus on the database design BEFORE coding has begun, eg. during the project planning or design phase. (12 POINTS)



![SM_API](src/docs/ERD_DIN.png)



To ensure a robust and efficient Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) setup for my API, the initial and crucial step is the creation of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). An ERD provides a visual representation of each 'entity' as a table, detailing its attributes; including primaary keys (PKs) and foreign keys (FKs). This diagram is instrumental in comprehansive planning and structuring of the ORM by defining unique identifiers for each table, which ensures that every record can be unniquely referenced and retrieved. Additionally, the ERD maps the relationships between entities: such as, one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many, allowing for a clear understanding of how data interrelates.


Within my ERD design, I have colour-coded the entities and constructed a "Database Colour Legend" so the viewer is able to easily identify what each colour signifies.

* `Core Entity Table` --> these entity tables have been colour coded in purple. I've used this terminology in the database legend so that theoretically, other developers/viewers would be able to see which entities will be decidedly included in the API.
  
* `Association Table` --> the entity tables in green signify the association or junction tables within the database. By highlighting these in a different colour to the "core" entity tables, other developers will be able to delineate that way in which they form a bridge between two core entity tables in order to facilitate many-to-many relationships. Although the `Followers` table does not provide as a junction between two core entities, it still fosters a many-to-many relationship between `User` and `Followers` tables, thus can still be considered an association table.
  
* `Proposed Tables` --> the entity tables that have been colour-coded yellow signify "proposed" tables. In theory, these tables represent proposed features to add to the API; which would be a very useful feature, particularly when collaborating within a development team. In the context of my API, they represent proposed additional features that I would like to incorporate if I feel as though I can complete them within the allotted time.
  
* `Primary Key` --> in order to promote consistency and clarification, I've colored the primary keys and their associated data type in red: This is also outlined in the database legend. Furthermore, to elucidate these elements further, I have placed them in bold text and identified them using a `(PK)` notation. This allows the viewer to find these key elements faster.
  
* `Foreign Key` --> 



This visualisation is essential for designing the database schema in order to achieve data normalisation, which minimises redundancy and avoids data duplication, thus leading to a more consistent and manageable database. Furthermore, by illustrating FK relationships, the ERD aids in enforing referential integrity, thus ensuring that relationships between table are accurately maintained.

```
- Create a detailed ERD with a detailed explanation of how all the relations depicted in the ERD are normalised
- ERD must include a legend/key of the notation and styles, matching a notation or style identified in the accompanying explanation
- Must include comparisons to how at least ONE model/relations would in other level sof normalisation that the one shown in the ERD
```




### 7. Explain the implemented models and their relationships, including how the relationships aid the database implementation.
### This should focus on the database implementation AFTER coding has begun, eg. during the project development phase.



**1) InnovationThread Model**

This model allows the user to create a thread to facilitate innovative ideas and spark discussion with other platform users. Each attribute of this table is defined as a column, specifying the data types and constraints for each attribute. For example, the thread `id` is identified as both an integer and the primary key (`id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)`). When posting a thread, I've ensured that the title and content (original post to start the thread) cannot be null as indicated by the `nullable=False` attributes. I've also imported the `datetime` module in order to include a timestamp of when the thread was originally created, which is set to default at the current time (`db.Column(db.DateTime, default=func.now())`). This model also includes the `user_id` as a foreign key, as this is an original attribute of the `User` model; it is linked here in order identify the creator of the thread. A many-to-one relationship is established with the `User` model, as each thread is associated with one user. Including `user = db.relationship("User", back_populates="threads")` in the model enables the retrieval of the user who created the thread. Similarly, `posts = db.relationship("Post", back_populates="threads", lazy=True, cascade="all, delete-orphan")` establishes a one-to-many relationship with the `Post` model as each thread can have multiple posts. Furthermore, the `cascade="all, delete-orphan"` option ensures that if a thread is deleted, all associated posts are also deleted. When using the "POST" method for the "/threads" route, `user_id=get_jwt_identity()` is used to extract the creator's information so that the user_id can be retrieved using the queries in the "GET" methods.

I've created four separate CRUD operations specifically for posts on threads, included in the `post_controller.py` file; the queries of which reference these relationships within the InnovationThread model in order to retrieve information from the User and Post objects. For example, in order to retrieve all posts on a specific thread (`get_all_posts_in_thread`), it begins a query to select records from the `Post` table using `db.select(Post)`, then uses `.filter_by(thread_id=thread_id)` to filter the posts to only include those with a `thread_id` that match the thread_id specified in the route. In order for this to work, the relationship to the `Post` object must exist within the `InnovationThread` model and vice versa (`threads = db.relationship("InnovationThread", back_populates="posts")` within the `Post` model). The thread_id must also be included in the Post model as a foerign key.

Therefore, when I seed the Postgres database, I should be able to see `id` (thread, PK), `title`, `content`, `timestamp` and `user_id` as the columns within the "thread" table:


![innovation_thread](/src/docs/innovation%20thread_model.png)



**2) User Model**


The User Model involves all the attributes typically found in a customary social media profile. Similarly, to the InnovationThread model, this model defines the `id` (user_id) as the primary key of the table (`primary_key=True`). Although this will be the unique identifier, the user will also be able to set their own username, password and email in order to register and log into their account. All 3 of these are core attributes, and have thus been made not nullable fields. Furthermore, the email must be unique in order to be able to register the account. In order for the user to be able to use the platform for professional networking, I've allowed a series of optional attributes for the user to include in order to share more information about themselves to their followers: `profile_picture_url`, `bio`, `date_of_birth`, `location`, `website_url`, `linkedin_url`, `github_url`, `skills`, `job_title`. The `is_admin` attribute will default to False, thus must be specified by the administrator in order to be registered as such.

There are a series of relationship that have been established within this model, as all of the other models involve operations that can only be executed by the users:

`threads` --> establishes a one-to-many relationship with the `InnovationThread` model, as each user can create multiple threads.

`posts` --> establishes a one-to-many relationship with the `Post` model, as each user can create multiple posts.

`comments` --> establishes a one-to-many relationship with the `Comment` model, as each user can make mutiple comments.

`likes` --> establishes a one-to-many relationship with the `Like` model, as each user can like multiple posts.

`followers_assoc` --> establishes a many-to-many self-referential relationship for tracking users who are followed.

`following_assoc` --> establishes a many-to-many self-referential relationship for tracking users who follow others.

Once the database is seeded, I will be able to see all of these columns within the Postgres database:


![user_model](/src/docs/user_model.png)


If we look at the controller of one of these relationships, such as the "POST" method for comment, we can see the way this relationship is incorporated:
```
        comment = Comment(
            comment_body=comment_body,
            timestamp=date.today(),
            post_id=post.id,
            user_id=get_jwt_identity()
        )
```
Within this example, `user_id=get_jwt_identity()` is used to retireve the current user' ID from the JWT in order to identify and track the creator of the comment within the database.
All of these attributes allow for a comprehensive user profile, particularly for individuals looking to foster new professional connections using the platform. Furthermore, relationships between models facilitates interconnectivity throughout the API.



**3) Post Model**


The post model allows the user to post from their account. The core attributes within this model involve the `id` (post_id) as the primary key, the `body` of the post (`nullable=False`) and a timestamp of when the post was created (defaults to the current time). There are 2 foreign keys identified within this model: the `user_id`, allowing identification of the user creating the post, and the `threads_id`, in the event that the  posts is posted on an existing thread. Within the `post_controllers.py` file, you will see double the amount of CRUD operations; this is necessary as different end points are required in order to allow the user to post on their main feed vs. on an existing post.

There are 4 relationships established within this model, allowing the model to interact with each respective model:

`threads` --> estiblishes a many-to-one relationship with the 'InnovationThread' model, as many posts may belong to one specific thread. Having said that, the posts do not have to have a relationship with a thread and can be posted to the main feed, depending on the end point selected.

`user` --> establishes a many-to-one relationship with the `User` model, as each post is created by a specific user.

`comments` --> establishes a one-to-many relationship with the `Comment` model, as each post can have multiple comments.

`likes` --> establishes a one-to-many relationship with the `Like` model, as each post can be liked by multiple users.

The posts model allows the user to post to their main feed and within organised thread discussions. Furthermore, the relationship between this model and the 'Like' and 'Comment' models enables useer interation. When the database is seeded, we will see all of the defined columns within this model:

![post_model](/src/docs/post_model.png)

Let's review an example of why these relationships are necessary. When examining the relationship between the `Post` and `Like` objects, we can look at the queries used within the controllers to identify the relationship:
```
def get_post_likes(post_id):
    stmt = db.select(Post).filter_by(id=post_id)
    post = db.session.scalar(stmt)

    if post is None:
        return {"error": f"Post with ID {post_id} not found."}, 404
        
    likes = Like.query.filter_by(post_id=post.id).all()
    return likes_schema.dump(likes), 200
```
 Within the `get_post_likes` method, `db.select(Post).filter_by(id=post_id)` is used to first query the `Post` table for the post with the given post_id, with `db.session.scalar(stmt)` executing the select statement and returning a single result (the post) if it exists. Furthermore, `Like.query.filter_by(post_id=post.id).all()` uses SQLAlchemy to query the `Like` table and filters by post_id to reitreve all the likes associated with the post. In this way, the relationship established with the `Like` model is crucial as the "like" function entirely depends on whether or not a post exists.


**4) Comment Model**


The comment model is designed to allow the user to comment on posts; they can either post on posts on their main feed or posts within exitsting threads. The `id` within the model has been defined as the primary key (`primary_key=True`), which means that this attribute can be used to uniquely identify each comment. Furthermore, the comment will require a body of content (`comment_body`), which is why I've made this attribute not nullable. Lastly, I've included a timestamp, which uses a SQLAlchemy `func` import to set the default timestamp to the current time. There are 2 necessary foreign keys defined within this model: the `user_id` and the `post_id`. For this reason, relationships have been established between this model and both the `User` and `Post` models:
```
user = db.relationship("User", back_populates="comments")
posts = db.relationship("Post", back_populates="comments")
```

`user` --> esablishes a many-to-one relationship, as each comment is associated with a single user (the account from which the comment is posted). Within the "POST" operation in the comment controllers, `user_id=get_jwt_identity()` is used to retireve the current user' ID from the JWT in order to identify and track the creator of the comment within the database.

`post` --> estbalishes a many-to-one relationship, as each comment is associated with one post (the post on which the user is commenting). Let's examine an example from the "POST" method in the comment controllers:
```
        body_data = request.get_json()
        stmt = db.select(Post).filter_by(id=post_id)
        post = db.session.scalar(stmt)
```
Within this code example, `db.select(Post)` initialises a query to select records from the `Post` table, while `.filter_by(id=post_id)` adds a filter condition to query to match the post with the `post_id` specified in the route. `db.session.scalar(stmt)` is then used to execute the query. This is necessary as the first step before executing the rest of the code, as the operation must find a post on which to comment before allowing the user to execute a comment. By examining this query, we're able to understand the relationship between the `Comment` and `Post` objects and why it's necessary that they're established within the models.

After seeding the database, I will be able to see the columns as: `id` (comment_id, PK), `comment_body_`, `timestamp`, `user_id` (FK) and `post_id` (FK), as shown below:


![comment_model](/src/docs/comment_model.png)





**5) Like Model**


The `Like` model represents the action of a user liking a post. This model includes an `id` (like_id) as the primary key (`primary_key=True`), which uniquely identifies each like record within the database. The `user_id` and `post_id` fields are foreign keys that link to the `User` and `Post` models, respectively.

`user` --> establishes a many-to-one relationship with the `User` model, as each like is associated with a single user but one user is able like multiiple posts. `db.relationship("User", back_populates="likes")` ensured that the `User` models's `likes` relationship is kept synchronised. Let's review an example of how this relationship is referenced in a query:
```
@likes_bp.route("/", methods=["GET"])
def get_post_likes(post_id):
    stmt = db.select(Post).filter_by(id=post_id)
    post = db.session.scalar(stmt)

    if post is None:
        return {"error": f"Post with ID {post_id} not found."}, 404
        
    likes = Like.query.filter_by(post_id=post.id).all()
    return likes_schema.dump(likes), 200
```
Within this snippet of code, `db.select(Post).filter_by(id=post_id)` creates a query to find the `Post` with the specified `post_id`, while `db.session.scalar(stmt)` executes the query to get the `Post` object. Furthermore, `Like.query.filter_by(post_id=post.id).all()` finds all records associated witht he retrieved `Post` object using the post_id. This query demonstrates a many-to-one relationship between "likes" and "posts".


`posts` --> establishes a many-to-one relationship with the `Post` model, as each like is associated with a single post. `db.relationship("Post", back_populates="likes")` ensures that the `Post` model's `likes` relationship is kept synchronised. Let's review an example of where this relationship is demonstrated:
```
# Like a post - POST - /post/<int:post_id>/likes
@likes_bp.route("/", methods=["POST"])
@jwt_required()
def like_post(post_id):
    try:
        user_id = get_jwt_identity()
        stmt = db.select(Post).filter_by(id=post_id)
        post = db.session.scalar(stmt)

        if not post:
            return {"error": f"Post with ID {post_id} not found."}, 404
        
        if str(post.user_id) == str(user_id):
            return {"error": f"You cannot like your own post."}, 403
        
        existing_like = Like.query.filter_by(user_id=user_id, post_id=post.id).first()
        if existing_like:
            return {"error": f"Post with ID {post_id} already liked."}, 400
        
        new_like = Like(
            user_id=user_id,
            post_id=post.id
        )
        db.session.add(new_like)
        db.session.commit()
        return like_schema.dump(new_like), 201
```
Within this snippet of code, the JWT is stored as a variable `user_id` and refernced later in the code: `Like.query.filter_by(user_id=user_id, post_id=post.id).first()` is a query used to check whether the current user has already liked the specified post. In order for this to be executed, it must utilise the relationship established between `Like` and `User/Post`.

After seeding the database, the column displayed should involve `id` (like_id, PK), `user_id` (FK) and `post_id` (FK):
